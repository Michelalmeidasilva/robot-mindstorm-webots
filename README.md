## Rover Project

This is a project for a Rover competition in Webots. The Rover is a simulated robot that must navigate a simulated environment and complete a set of tasks. The Rover is controlled by a program written in Python.

## The Rover

The Rover is a simulated robot that is made up of the following components:

* A chassis
* A motor
* A sensor
* A controller

The chassis is the base of the Rover. It is responsible for carrying the other components of the Rover. The motor is responsible for moving the Rover. The sensor is responsible for detecting objects in the environment. The controller is responsible for controlling the motor and sensor.

## The Environment

The Rover navigates a simulated environment that is made up of the following objects:

* Walls
* Obstacles
* Targets

The Walls are the boundaries of the environment. The Obstacles are objects that the Rover must avoid. The Targets are objects that the Rover must collect.

## The Tasks

The Rover must complete the following tasks:
* Avoid the obstacles

## The Program

The program that controls the Rover is written in Python. The program uses the following modules:

* Webots

The Webots module is used to interact with the Webots simulator. The NumPy module is used for mathematical operations. The Matplotlib module is used for plotting graphs.

## How to Use

To use the Rover Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the repository directory.
3. Run the following command to start the simulator:


webots --world world.wbt

## Conclusion

The Rover Project is a simulated robot that can be used to learn about robotics and artificial intelligence. The project is designed to be used in a competition, but it can also be used for educational purposes.
